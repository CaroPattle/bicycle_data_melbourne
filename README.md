# Open Data Stories

How do we live, work, and play? Letâ€™s find out by looking at some open data! This GitHub repository contains the code for a Github Pages website https://caropattle.github.io/data_stories/ where I will be posting a series of data stories which visualise open datasets accessible via DataVic. In addition to the website and analysis code hosted in this repository, there is a [blog](https://caropattle.github.io/data_stories/blog/) describing how data was wrangled and shaped using open-source tools.

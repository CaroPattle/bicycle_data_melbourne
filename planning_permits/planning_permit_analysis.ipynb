    "The summary dataset aggregates data from separate annual datesets which run from to 2020 (https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/building-permit-activity-data-2020). ** up to 2021 on building vic autority (VBA) site ** Within these datasets, each record or row represents a single permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "These annual datasets include over 40 pieces of information per record, such as details of what is to be built (or demolished),the intended use of the building, the ownership sector, and the building costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the location of the building can be viewed down to the street name level, with postal codes, suburbs and regions also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive data dictionary for the building permit datsets can be found on the VBA site here (https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/about/data), as well as a detailed data quality statement PDF which includes clear summaries about what the data represents."
